# Urban Greenspace and Asthma Prevalence

## Get Started with Big Data Pipelines

Vegetation has the potential to provide many ecosystem services in urban
areas, such as cleaner air and water and flood mitigation.
However, the
results are mixed on relationships between a simple measurement of
vegetation cover (such as average NDVI, a measurement of vegetation
health) and human health.
We do, however, find relationships between
landscape metrics that attempt to quantify the connectivity and
structure of greenspace and human health.
These types of metrics include
mean patch size, edge density, and fragmentation.

Read More: Study by 
[Tsai et al. 2019](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11252-018-0813-3)
on the relationship between edge density and life expectancy in Baltimore, MD.
The authors also discuss the influence of scale (e.g. the resolution
of the imagery) on these relationships, which is important for this case study.

In this notebook, you will write code to calculate patch, edge, and
fragmentation statistics about urban greenspace in Chicago.
These statistics should be reflective of the connectivity and spread of urban
greenspace, which are important for ecosystem function and access.
You will then use a linear model to identify statistically significant
correlations between the distribution of greenspace and health data
compiled by the US Center for Disease Control.

### Working with larger-than-memory (big) data

For this project, we are going to split up the green space (NDVI) data
by census tract, because this matches the human health data from the CDC.
If we were interested in the average NDVI at this spatial scale, we
could easily use a source of multispectral data like Landsat (30m) or
even MODIS (250m) without a noticeable impact on our results.
However, because we need to know more about the structure of green space within
each tract, we need higher resolution data. For that, we will access the
National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data, which is taken for
the continental US every few years at 1m resolution.
That’s enough to see individual trees and cars!
The main purpose of the NAIP data is, as the name suggests, agriculture.
However, it’s also a great source for urban areas where lots is happening
on a very small scale.

The NAIP data for the City of Chicago takes up about 20GB of space.
This amount of data is likely to crash your kernel if you try to load it all
in at once.
It also would be inconvenient to store on your hard drive so
that you can load it in a bit at a time for analysis.
Even if your are
using a computer that would be able to handle this amount of data,
imagine if you were analysing the entire United States over multiple
years!

To help with this problem, you will use cloud-based tools to calculate
your statistics instead of downloading rasters to your computer or container.
You can crop the data entirely in the cloud, thereby saving
on your memory and internet connection, using
[rioxarray](https://corteva.github.io).

### Check your work with testing!

This notebook does not have pre-built tests.
You will need to write your
own test code to make sure everything is working the way that you want.
For many operations, this will be as simple as creating a plot to check
that all your data lines up spatially the way you were expecting, or
printing values as you go.
However, if you don’t test as you go, you are
likely to end up with intractable problems with the final code.

## STEP 1: Set up your analysis

Import necessary packages

- Create **reproducible file paths** for your project file structure.
- To use cloud-optimized 
[GeoTiffs](),
we recommend some settings to make sure your code does not get stopped
by a momentary connection lapse – see the code cell below.

```{python}
# pip install --quiet ~/Documents/GitHub/landmapy
```

```{python}
# Import libraries
import os
import pathlib
import time
import warnings

import geopandas as gpd
import geoviews as gv
import holoviews as hv
import hvplot.pandas
import hvplot.xarray
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pystac_client
import rioxarray as rxr
import rioxarray.merge as rxrmerge
import shapely
import xarray as xr
from cartopy import crs as ccrs
from scipy.ndimage import convolve
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from scipy.ndimage import label
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tqdm.notebook import tqdm
from landmapy.habitat import create_data_dir
```

```{python}
data_dir = create_data_dir('chicago-greenspace')
    
warnings.simplefilter('ignore')

# Prevent GDAL from quitting due to momentary disruptions
os.environ["GDAL_HTTP_MAX_RETRY"] = "5"
os.environ["GDAL_HTTP_RETRY_DELAY"] = "1"
```

## STEP 2: Create a site map

We’ll be using the Center for Disease Control (CDC) Places dataset for
human health data to compare with vegetation. CDC Places also provides
some modified census tracts, clipped to the city boundary, to go along
with the health data. We’ll start by downloading the matching geographic
data, and then select the City of Chicago.

You can obtain urls for the U.S. Census Tract shapefiles from the
[TIGER service](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.html).
You’ll notice that these URLs use the 
[state FIPS](https://www.bls.gov/respondents/mwr/electronic-data-interchange/appendix-d-usps-state-abbreviations-and-fips-codes.htm),
which you can get installing and using the 
[us](https://pypi.org/project/us/)
package.

- Download the Census tract Shapefile that goes along with CDC places
  -  `tract_path = shp_tract_path(data_dir, place='chicago-tract')`
  -  `chi_tract_gdf = download_census_tract(tract_path, placename='Chicago')`
- Use a **conditional statement** to cache your download.
  - `if not os.path.exists(tract_path):`
- Use a **row filter** to select only the census tracts in Chicago
  - `tract_gdf[tract_gdf.PlaceName == placename]`
- Use a **spatial join** to select only the Census tracts
that lie at least partially within the City of Chicago boundary.
  - **_Not sure what this means._**

There is no need to cache the full dataset – stick with your pared down
version containing only Chicago.

```{python}
# from landmapy.bigdata import shp_tract_path, download_census_tract, hvplot_tract_gdf
%run bigdata.py
```

```{python}
# Set up the census tract path
tract_path = shp_tract_path(data_dir, 'chicago-tract')
chi_tract_gdf = download_census_tract(tract_path, 'Chicago')
```

```{python}
hvplot_tract_gdf(chi_tract_gdf)
```

**Reflect and Respond**

What do you notice about the City of Chicago from the coarse satellite image?
Is green space evenly distributed? What can you learn about Chicago from websites,
scientific papers, or other resources that might help explain what you see in the site map?

**WRITE YOUR CITY OF CHICAGO DATA DESCRIPTION AND CITATION HERE**

### Download census tracts and select your urban area

- Download the Census tract Shapefile for the state of Illinois (IL).
- Use a **conditional statement** to cache the download

## STEP 3 - Access Asthma and Urban Greenspaces Data

### Access human health data

The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) provides a number of health
variables through their
[Places Dataset](https://www.cdc.gov/places/)
that might be correlated with urban greenspace.
For this assignment, start with adult asthma.
Try to limit the data as much as possible for download.
Selecting the state and county is one way to do this.

- Access Places data with an API, but as with many APIs it is
easier to test out your search before building a URL.
Navigate to the
[Places Census Tract Data Portal](https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-Census-Tract-D)
and search for the data you want.
- The data portal will make an API call for you, but there is a
simpler, easier to read and modify way to form an API call.
Check out to the 
[socrata documentation](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/endpoints)
to see how.
You can also find some limited examples and a list of available parameters for this API on
[CDC Places SODA Consumer API Documentation](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.cdc.gov/cwsq-ngmh)
- Once you have formed your query, you may notice that you have exactly 1000 rows.
The Places SODA API limits you to 1000 records in a
download.
Either narrow your search or check out the
`&$limit=` parameter to increase the number of rows
downloaded. You can find more information on the
[Paging page of the SODA API documentation](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/paging)
- You should also clean up this data by renaming the
`'data_value'` to something descriptive, and possibly
selecting a subset of columns.

```{python}
# Preview asthma data
cdc_df = download_cdc_disease(data_dir, 'asthma')
cdc_df
```

### Join health data with census tract boundaries

- Join the census tract `GeoDataFrame` with the asthma
prevalence `DataFrame` using the `.merge()` method.
- You will need to change the data type of one of the merge columns to
match, e.g. using `.astype('int64')`
- There are a few census tracts in Chicago that do not have data. You
should be able to confirm that they are not listed through the
interactive Places Data Portal.
However, if you have large chunks of the
city missing, it may mean that you need to expand the record limit for
your download.


```{python}
tract_cdc_gdf = join_tract_cdc(chi_tract_gdf, cdc_df)
plot_gv(tract_cdc_gdf)
```

**Reflect and Respond**

Write a description and citation for the asthma prevalence data.
Do you notice anything about the spatial distribution of asthma in Chicago?
From your research on the city, what might be some potential causes of
any patterns you see?

**ADD YOUR CDC PLACES DESCRIPTION AND CITATION HERE**

### Get Data URLs

NAIP data are freely available through the Microsoft Planetary Computer
SpatioTemporal Access Catalog (STAC).

Get started with STAC by accessing the planetary computer catalog
with the following code:</p>

```{python}
# Connect to the planetary computer catalog
e84_catalog = pystac_client.Client.open(
    "https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1"
)
e84_catalog.title
```

- Using a loop, for each Census Tract:
  - Use the following sample code to search for data, replacing the
names with applicable values with descriptive names:

```
search = e84_catalog.search(
    collections=["naip"],
    intersects=shapely.to_geojson(tract_geometry),
    datetime=f"{year}"
)
```

  - Access the url using `search.assets['image'].href`
- Accumulate the urls in a `pd.DataFrame` or `dict` for later
- Occasionally you may find that the STAC service is momentarily unavailable.
You should include code that will retry the request up to 5
times when you get the `pystac_client.exceptions.APIError`

> **Warning**
>
> As always – DO NOT try to write this loop all at once! Stick with one
> step at a time, making sure to test your work. You also probably want
> to add a `break` into your loop to stop the loop after a single
> iteration. This will help prevent long waits during debugging.


```{python}
# Convert geometry to lat/lon for STAC
tract_latlon_gdf = tract_cdc_gdf.to_crs(4326)

# Define a path to save NDVI stats
ndvi_stats_path = os.path.join(data_dir, 'chicago-ndvi-stats.csv')

# Check for existing data - do not access duplicate tracts
downloaded_tracts = []
if os.path.exists(ndvi_stats_path):
    ndvi_stats_df = pd.read_csv(ndvi_stats_path)
    downloaded_tracts = ndvi_stats_df.tract.values
else:
    print('No census tracts downloaded so far')
    
# Loop through each census tract
scene_dfs = []
for i, tract_values in tqdm(tract_latlon_gdf.iterrows()):
    tract = tract_values.tract2010
    # Check if statistics are already downloaded for this tract
    if not (tract in downloaded_tracts):
        # Retry up to 5 times in case of a momentary disruption
        i = 0
        retry_limit = 5
        while i < retry_limit:
            # Try accessing the STAC
            try:
                # Search for tiles
                naip_search = e84_catalog.search(
                    collections=["naip"],
                    intersects=shapely.to_geojson(tract_values.geometry),
                    datetime="2021"
                )
                
                # Build dataframe with tracts and tile urls
                scene_dfs.append(pd.DataFrame(dict(
                    tract=tract,
                    date=[pd.to_datetime(scene.datetime).date() 
                          for scene in naip_search.items()],
                    rgbir_href=[scene.assets['image'].href for scene in naip_search.items()],
                )))
                
                break
            # Try again in case of an APIError
            except pystac_client.exceptions.APIError:
                print(
                    f'Could not connect with STAC server. '
                    f'Retrying tract {tract}...')
                time.sleep(2)
                i += 1
                continue
    
# Concatenate the url dataframes
if scene_dfs:
    scene_df = pd.concat(scene_dfs).reset_index(drop=True)
else:
    scene_df = None

# Preview the URL DataFrame
scene_df
```

### Compute NDVI Statistics

Next, calculate some metrics to get at different aspects of the
distribution of greenspace in each census tract.
These types of statistics are called **fragmentation statistics**, and can be
implemented with the `scipy` package. Some examples of fragmentation
statistics are:

- Percentage vegetation:  
The percentage of pixels that exceed a vegetation threshold (.12 is
common with Landsat) Mean patch size
- Patches:
The average size of **patches**, or contiguous area exceeding the
vegetation threshold. Patches can be identified with the `label`
function from `scipy.ndimage` Edge density
- Edges:
The proportion of edge pixels among vegetated pixels. Edges can be
identified by **convolving** the image with a **kernel** designed to
detect pixels that are different from their surroundings.

- Select census row(s)
  - Select a single row from the census tract `GeoDataFrame`
using e.g. `.loc[[0]]`
  - Select all the rows from your URL `DataFrame` that match the census tract.
- For each URL in crop, merge, clip, and compute NDVI for that census
tract
- Set a threshold to get a binary mask of vegetation
- Using the sample code to compute the fragmentation statistics.
Feel free to add any other statistics you think are relevant, but make sure
to include a fraction vegetation, mean patch size, and edge density.
If you are not sure what any line of code is doing, make a plot or print
something to find out! 
You can also ask ChatGPT or the class.

```{python}
# Skip this step if data are already downloaded 
if not scene_df is None:
    # Get an example tract
    tract = chi_tract_gdf.loc[0].tract2010
    ex_scene_gdf = scene_df[scene_df.tract==tract]

    # Loop through all images for tract
    tile_das = []
    for _, href_s in ex_scene_gdf.iterrows():
        # Open vsi connection to data
        tile_da = rxr.open_rasterio(
            href_s.rgbir_href, masked=True).squeeze()
        
        # Crop data to the bounding box of the census tract
        boundary = (
            tract_cdc_gdf
            .set_index('tract2010')
            .loc[[tract]]
            .to_crs(tile_da.rio.crs)
            .geometry
        )
        crop_da = tile_da.rio.clip_box(
            *boundary.envelope.total_bounds,
            auto_expand=True)

        # Clip data to the boundary of the census tract
        clip_da = crop_da.rio.clip(boundary, all_touched=True)
            
        # Compute NDVI
        ndvi_da = (
            (clip_da.sel(band=4) - clip_da.sel(band=1)) 
            / (clip_da.sel(band=4) + clip_da.sel(band=1))
        )

        # Accumulate result
        tile_das.append(ndvi_da)

    # Merge data
    scene_da = rxrmerge.merge_arrays(tile_das)

    # Mask vegetation
    veg_mask = (scene_da>.3)

    # Calculate mean patch size
    labeled_patches, num_patches = label(veg_mask)
    # Count patch pixels, ignoring background at patch 0
    patch_sizes = np.bincount(labeled_patches.ravel())[1:]
    mean_patch_size = patch_sizes.mean()

    # Calculate edge density
    kernel = np.array([
        [1, 1, 1], 
        [1, -8, 1], 
        [1, 1, 1]])
    edges = convolve(veg_mask, kernel, mode='constant')
    edge_density = np.sum(edges != 0) / veg_mask.size
```

### Repeat for all tracts

- Using a loop, for each Census Tract:
  - Using a loop, for each data URL:
    - Use `rioxarray` to open up a connection to the STAC
asset, just like you would a file on your computer
    - Crop and then clip your data to the census tract boundary &gt; HINT:
check out the `.clip_box` parameter `auto_expand`
and the `clip` parameter `all_touched` to make
sure you don’t end up with an empty array
    - Compute NDVI for the tract
  - Merge the NDVI rasters
  - Compute:
    - total number of pixels within the tract
    - fraction of pixels with an NDVI greater than .12 within the tract
(and any other statistics you would like to look at)
  - Accumulate the statistics in a file for later
- Using a conditional statement, ensure that you do not run this
computation if you have already saved values.
You do not want to run this step many times, or have to restart from scratch!
There are many approaches to this, but we actually recommend implementing your caching
in the previous cell when you generate your dataframe of URLs, since
that step can take a few minutes as well.
However, the important thing to cache is the computation.

```{python}
# Skip this step if data are already downloaded 
if not scene_df is None:
    ndvi_dfs = []
    # Loop through the census tracts with URLs
    for tract, tract_date_gdf in tqdm(scene_df.groupby('tract')):
        # Open all images for tract
        tile_das = []
        for _, href_s in tract_date_gdf.iterrows():
            # Open vsi connection to data
            tile_da = rxr.open_rasterio(
                href_s.rgbir_href, masked=True).squeeze()
            
            # Clip data
            boundary = (
                tract_cdc_gdf
                .set_index('tract2010')
                .loc[[tract]]
                .to_crs(tile_da.rio.crs)
                .geometry
            )
            crop_da = tile_da.rio.clip_box(
                *boundary.envelope.total_bounds,
                auto_expand=True)
            clip_da = crop_da.rio.clip(boundary, all_touched=True)
                
            # Compute NDVI
            ndvi_da = (
                (clip_da.sel(band=4) - clip_da.sel(band=1)) 
                / (clip_da.sel(band=4) + clip_da.sel(band=1))
            )

            # Accumulate result
            tile_das.append(ndvi_da)

        # Merge data
        scene_da = rxrmerge.merge_arrays(tile_das)

        # Mask vegetation
        veg_mask = (scene_da>.3)

        # Calculate statistics and save data to file
        total_pixels = scene_da.notnull().sum()
        veg_pixels = veg_mask.sum()

        # Calculate mean patch size
        labeled_patches, num_patches = label(veg_mask)
        # Count patch pixels, ignoring background at patch 0
        patch_sizes = np.bincount(labeled_patches.ravel())[1:] 
        mean_patch_size = patch_sizes.mean()

        # Calculate edge density
        kernel = np.array([
            [1, 1, 1], 
            [1, -8, 1], 
            [1, 1, 1]])
        edges = convolve(veg_mask, kernel, mode='constant')
        edge_density = np.sum(edges != 0) / veg_mask.size
        
        # Add a row to the statistics file for this tract
        pd.DataFrame(dict(
            tract=[tract],
            total_pixels=[int(total_pixels)],
            frac_veg=[float(veg_pixels/total_pixels)],
            mean_patch_size=[mean_patch_size],
            edge_density=[edge_density]
        )).to_csv(
            ndvi_stats_path, 
            mode='a', 
            index=False, 
            header=(not os.path.exists(ndvi_stats_path))
        )

# Re-load results from file
ndvi_stats_df = pd.read_csv(ndvi_stats_path)
ndvi_stats_df
```

## STEP 3 - Explore your data with plots

### Chloropleth plots

Before running any statistical models on your data, you should check
that your download worked. You should see differences in both median
income and mean NDVI across the City.

Create a plot that contains:

- 2 side-by-side Chloropleth plots
- Asthma prevelence on one and mean NDVI on the other
- Make sure to include a title and labeled color bars

```{python}
# Merge census data with geometry
chi_ndvi_cdc_gdf = (
    tract_cdc_gdf
    .merge(
        ndvi_stats_df,
        left_on='tract2010', right_on='tract', how='inner')
)

# Plot chloropleths with vegetation statistics
def plot_chloropleth(gdf, **opts):
    """Generate a chloropleth with the given color column"""
    return gv.Polygons(
        gdf.to_crs(ccrs.Mercator()),
        crs=ccrs.Mercator()
    ).opts(xaxis=None, yaxis=None, colorbar=True, **opts)

(
    plot_chloropleth(
        chi_ndvi_cdc_gdf, color='asthma', cmap='viridis')
    + 
    plot_chloropleth(chi_ndvi_cdc_gdf, color='edge_density', cmap='Greens')
)
```


Do you see any similarities in your plots?
Do you think there is a
relationship between adult asthma and any of your vegetation statistics in Chicago?
Relate your visualization to the research you have done (the
context of your analysis) if applicable.

**ADD YOUR PLOT DESCRIPTION HERE**

## STEP 4: Explore a linear ordinary least-squares regression

### Model description

One way to find if there is a statistically significant relationship
between asthma prevalence and greenspace metrics is to run a linear
ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and measure how well it is able
to predict asthma given your chosen fragmentation statistics.

Before fitting an OLS regression, you should check that your data are
appropriate for the model.

Write a model description for the linear ordinary least-squares
regression that touches on:

- Assumptions made about the data
- What is the objective of this model? What metrics could you use to
evaluate the fit?
- Advantages and potential problems with choosing this model.

**ADD YOUR CDC PLACES DESCRIPTION AND CITATION HERE**

### Data preparation

When fitting statistical models, you should make sure that your data
meet the model assumptions through a process of selection and/or
transformation.

You can select data by:

-   Eliminating observations (rows) or variables (columns) that are
    missing data
-   Selecting a model that matches the way in which variables are
    related to each other (for example, linear models are not good at
    modeling circles)
-   Selecting variables that explain the largest amount of variability
    in the dependent variable.

You can transform data bt:

-   Transforming a variable so that it follows a normal distribution.
    The `log` transform is the most common to eliminate excessive skew
    (e.g. make the data symmetrical), but you should select a transform
    most suited to your data.
-   Normalizing or standardizing variables to, for example, eliminate
    negative numbers or effects caused by variables being in a different
    range.
-   Performing a principle component analysis (PCA) to eliminate
    multicollinearity among the predictor variables

> Keep in mind that data transforms like a log transform or a PCA must

- Use the `hvplot.scatter_matrix()` function to create an
exploratory plot of your data.
- Make any necessary adjustments to your data to make sure that they
meet the assumptions of a linear OLS regression.
- Check if there are `NaN` values, and if so drop those
rows and/or columns. You can use the `.dropna()` method to
drop rows with `NaN` values.
- Explain any data transformations or selections you made and why

```{python}
# Variable selection and transformation
model_df = (
    chi_ndvi_cdc_gdf
    .copy()
    [['frac_veg', 'asthma', 'mean_patch_size', 'edge_density', 'geometry']]
    .dropna()
)

model_df['log_asthma'] = np.log(model_df.asthma)

# Plot scatter matrix to identify variables that need transformation
hvplot.scatter_matrix(
    model_df
    [[ 
        'mean_patch_size',
        'edge_density',
        'log_asthma'
    ]]
    )
```

### Fit and Predict

If you have worked with statistical models before, you may notice that
the `scikitlearn` library has a slightly different approach than many
software packages. For example, `scikitlearn` emphasizes generic model
performance measures like cross-validation and importance over
coefficient p-values and correlation. The scikitlearn approach is meant
to generalize more smoothly to machine learning (ML) models where the
statistical significance is harder to derive mathematically.

- Use the scikitlearn documentation or ChatGPT as a starting point,
split your data into training and testing datasets.
- Fit a linear regression to your training data.
- Use your fitted model to predict the testing values.
- Plot the predicted values against the measured values. You can use
the following plotting code as a starting point.

```{python}
# Select predictor and outcome variables

X = model_df[['edge_density', 'mean_patch_size']]
y = model_df[['log_asthma']]

# Split into training and testing datasets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)

# Fit a linear regression
reg = LinearRegression()
reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict asthma values for the test dataset
y_test['pred_asthma'] = np.exp(reg.predict(X_test))
y_test['asthma'] = np.exp(y_test.log_asthma)

# Plot measured vs. predicted asthma prevalence with a 1-to-1 line
y_max = y_test.asthma.max()
(
    y_test
    .hvplot.scatter(
        x='asthma', y='pred_asthma',
        xlabel='Measured Adult Asthma Prevalence', 
        ylabel='Predicted Adult Asthma Prevalence',
        title='Linear Regression Performance - Testing Data'
    )
    .opts(aspect='equal', xlim=(0, y_max), ylim=(0, y_max), height=600, width=600)
) * hv.Slope(slope=1, y_intercept=0).opts(color='black')
```

### Spatial bias

We always need to think about bias, or systematic error, in model
results. Every model is going to have some error, but we’d like to see
that error evenly distributed. When the error is systematic, it can be
an indication that we are missing something important in the model.

In geographic data, it is common for location to be a factor that
doesn’t get incorporated into models. After all – we generally expect
places that are right next to each other to be more similar than places
that are far away (this phenomenon is known as *spatial
autocorrelation*). However, models like this linear regression don’t
take location into account at all.

- Compute the model error (predicted - measured) for all census
tracts
- Plot the error as a chloropleth map with a diverging color
scheme
- Looking at both of your error plots, what do you notice? What are
some possible explanations for any bias you see in your model?

```{python}
# Compute model error for all census tracts
model_df['pred_asthma'] = np.exp(reg.predict(X))
model_df['err_asthma'] = model_df['pred_asthma'] - model_df['asthma']

# Plot error geographically as a chloropleth
(
    plot_chloropleth(model_df, color='err_asthma', cmap='RdBu')
    .redim.range(err_asthma=(-.3, .3))
    .opts(frame_width=600, aspect='equal')
)
```
